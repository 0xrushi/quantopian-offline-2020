# quantopian-offline-2020
A collection of my quantopian learnings, trying to use everything locally and with updated code which works in 2020. After exhaustive search over the internet I managed to try zipline. There are no good third-party tutorials, their forum is old and many things have been changed since then, Actually I think zipline changes their syntax every year, their building block seems of poor structure, because as base libraries like pandas and numpy get updated, zipline finds it difficult to keep up to date with them. This repo works as of now in 2020 Not sure if it would work if you are reading this in 2025 or so. Newer changes are welcome.
Please star this repo if you find it useful.
